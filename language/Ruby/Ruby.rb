- Ruby doesn't care about whitespace (spaces and blank lines)
- Blocks can be defined with either the keywords do and end or with curly braces ({}).

Along with false, nil is one of two non-true values in Ruby (Every other object is regarded as "truthy," meaning that if you were to type if 2 or if "bacon", the code in that if statement would be run.)

Remember: there's always more than one way to do something in Ruby.
