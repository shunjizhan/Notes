# Knowledges
These are some knowledge that is great to keep in mind.

## Tips
- MacOS will not load `.bashrc` by default, so use `.bash_profile`

## Ruby & Rails
### How Does the ruby versions and the version manager works?
a couple importance env variables used by RVM:
- `GEM_HOME`     = /home/ji/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.5.7
- `GEM_PATH`     = /home/ji/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.5.7:/home/ji/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.5.7@global
- `MY_RUBY_HOME` = /home/ji/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.7      # ruby binary is in here: [here]/bin/ruby

for Thruby, it uses a env variable $RUBIES to find the ruby binary, so the migrate from RVM to Thruby, do `RUBIES+=(~/.rvm/rubies/*)`, which is to add the path for RVM installed rubies for Thuruby to find.

Actually, the Ruby version management tools are just wrappers that manage path to ruby binary and gems.
