request/response cycle:
	- A user opens his browser, types in a URL, and presses Enter.
	- When a user presses Enter, the browser makes a request for that URL.
	- The request hits the Rails router (config/routes.rb). The router maps the URL to the correct controller and action to handle the request.
	- The action receives the request and passes it on to the view.
	- The view renders the page as HTML.
	- The controller sends the HTML back to the browser. The page loads and the user sees it.

=begin
request/response cycle (with database):
	- A user opens his browser, types in a URL, and presses Enter. When a user presses Enter, the browser makes a request for that URL.
	- The request hits the Rails router (config/routes.rb).
	- The router maps the URL to the correct controller and action to handle the request.
	- The action receives the request, and asks the model to fetch data from the database.
	- The model returns a list of data to the controller action.
	- The controller action passes the data on to the view.
	- The view renders the page as HTML.
	- The controller sends the HTML back to the browser. The page loads and the user sees it.

$ rails generate model Message  
=begin
this command created a new model named Message. In doing so, Rails created two files:
	- a model file in app/models/message.rb. The model represents a table in the database.
	- a migration file in db/migrate/. Migrations are a way to update the database. The name of the migration file starts with the timestamp of when it was created.

      t.timestamps	# creates two more columns in the messages table called created_at and updated_at. These columns are automatically set when a message is created and updated.

The file index.html.erb is a web template. Web templates are HTML files that contain variables and control flow statements. 
Rather than write the same HTML over and over again for each message, we can use web templates to loop through and display data from the database.
The default web templating language in Rails is embedded Ruby, or ERB.
