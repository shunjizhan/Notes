# Notes
This is my personal notes about a variety of things:
- different programming languages notes that I wrote down during my learning process as my "knowledge cache", 
- reading notes from books and miscellaneous articles 
- trading ideas, experience and thoughts
- blockchian knowledges
- other notes

Feel free to reference to them if you need!
